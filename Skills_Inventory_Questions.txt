Skill #19: What’s the difference between a for loop and a while loop?
In processing a for loop will loop the number of times that is determined by variable conditions set in the for loop statement. 
Whereas a while loop will loop until the conidition is proven false. While loops are especially helpful when using booleans and 
for loops are better used for int's and float's. For example the loop " for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++){ " would be looped 3 times and 
the loop " while (play) { " would be looped until the boolean play is false.

Skill #22: What’s the difference between parameters and arguments?
Parameters are the variables that are assigned to a function and called when youa are creting that function. Parameters themselves never 
have concrete values but are rather the placeholder for the argument when the function is called. Arguments are the variables used in a function
that are defined when the function is called. The argument replaces the parameter wherever it is called.

Skill #25: What’s the difference between a class and an object?
A class is different from an object because a class is the template or guideline that is used to make an object. Every object has a parent
class that defines its traits and boundaries. To use a common anolgy, the class would be the cookie cutter and the objects are the cookies.

Skill #26: What is a constructor function? What does it do and when?


Skill #27: Why should each class have its own tab in Processing?


Skill #31: What’s the difference between an array and an ArrayList?
An array depicts a way to store a fixed number values. The values in an array must all be of the same type (int, float, char, string).
Arrays have a confined size that is declared. An ArrayList is very similar to an array but it is much more dynamic and flexible. 
ArrayLists are able to hold objects and do not have a definite size. You are able to freely add and remove things from an ArrayList unlike in an array.

Skill #32: Why would you want to go through a list backwards, decrementing the index?


Skill #37: When should you use PVector instead of float variables?
You should use PVector rather than float variables if there is ever a time when you have variables related to each other that would be better stored as one combined vector.
The most common example of this is in position, speed, and acceleration. PVector can be used to store values for these in a vector format (a vector being something with direction and magnitude)
PVectors can be two or three dimensional to fit your needs.

Skill #42: What is a normalized vector, why is it useful?
